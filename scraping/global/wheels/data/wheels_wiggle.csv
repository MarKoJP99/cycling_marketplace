Fulcrum Racing 6 Disc Road Wheelset,"Guaranteeing performance and reliability at a budget-friendly price, this road bike wheelset is fine-tuned for smooth performance wherever your ride takes you. Thanks to its hard-wearing aluminium rims, it provides excellent strength and durability as you clock up the miles. Fulcrum has also equipped this model with 24 stainless steel, straight-pull spokes and brass nipples for increased rigidity as you put the power down. Coming complete with sealed cartridge bearings, disc brake compatibility and a range of ride-enhancing technologies, this is a great choice for dependable performance at an affordable price.
The great versatility of these wheels, whether training or on road rides with a gravel bike, is ensured by the updated low profile 24mm aluminium rims and an inner rim channel of 20mm, with the 2 Way Fit system.
The technical specifications of the Racing 6 DB ensure that they excel in different situations, climbing as well as windy conditions, and they can also fit wider tyres, clincher or tubeless (tubeless tape installed and valves included).
2-Way Fit Technology
2-Way Fit profile for tubeless and clincher. Tubeless technology was first used by the auto industry, then by motorcycles and now has reached the cycling industry. After its debut with mountain bikes the moment has come to “put it on the road”, and that’s what Fulcrum propose to do. The brand has developed its 2-Way Fit technology to ensure the perfect compatibility of its tubeless rims with normal clincher types and tubes. 2-Way Fit road bike wheels are perfectly multipurpose for tackling every situation. Thanks to a special impression in the valve area, the tubes are fitted with maximum precision while keeping the tube perfectly stable inside the tyre. Housing the valve for tubeless tyres is also risk-free, with the unquestionable advantage that there are never any air infiltrations caused by non-ideal positioning when fitting.
AFS Axle System
The Axial Fixing System is the solution developed by Fulcrum to fix the disc brake to the hub. The constraint granted by the butt area of the release mechanism, greater than in familiar standard ones, makes it possible to obtain greater structural rigidity and therefore more precise and powerful braking.

Asymmetric Rim: The asymmetry is designed to improve rim tension, balancing the forces from brakes and sprocket cassette.
2-Way Fit Ready: This procedure transforms Racing 5 DB wheels (designed to be used with a clincher tyre and inner tube) into tubeless ready wheels (i.e. with a Tubeless Easy tyre, no inner tube and compulsory use of a sealant liquid). Use of tubeless and tubeless ready tyres is forbidden on 2-way Fit Ready rims without official Fulcrum 2-way Fit Ready adhesive tape. This model comes with tubeless type installed and valves included.

Campagnolo Zonda C17 Wheelset,"The completely redesigned rim for the Campagnolo Zonda C17 road wheels takes its design inspiration from the growing trend that sees the use of increasingly wider tyres, with 25mm clinchers becoming the standard if not the new minimum sizing for road riding and racing. With this increased popularity of both 25mm and 28mm tyres, the wheel needs to be designed in a way to optimise the tyre/wheel interface.
The updated wider rim on the Campagnolo Zonda C17 wheelset ensures a more efficient shape of the tyre, improving cornering grip and safety while reducing aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. This seemingly small increase in width offers a surprisingly different riding experience, one that is sure to leave any cyclist pleasantly convinced that this change is for the best. The C17 rim has also been structurally optimised and ensures a surefooted grip on clincher tyres, as well as even better braking, feel when compared with previous versions.",https://www.wiggle.com//p/campagnolo-zonda-c17-wheelset,"Campagnolo, Shimano/SRAM HG",£359.99 - £408.27

Fulcrum Racing 6 C17 Road Wheelset,"2:1 Two-To-One
Every push on the pedals from the rider will force most of that energy on the drive side of the rear wheel. To combat this loss of rim tension and power transfer, Fulcrum has solved this cycling problem with their 2:1 spoke ratio pattern by doubling the spoke count in crucial zones on the wheel.
Anti-Rotation System
This system locks the spoke in place once the correct tension is achieved. Engineers at Fulcrum have designed this system to ensure the spokes never lose their initial tension and to remain in the position that has been proven to provide the perfect aerodynamic properties.
Rim Dynamic Balance
Simple and Elegant, the weight of the rim gasket is balanced on the opposite side with an item of similar weight.",https://www.wiggle.com//p/fulcrum-racing-6-c17-road-wheelset,"Campagnolo, Shimano/SRAM HG",£129.99 - £159.99

Campagnolo Bora Ultra 35 Clincher Wheelset,"The Campagnolo Bora Ultra 35 Wheelset features CULT Ceramic bearings, which provide extreme smoothness, the lowest friction coefficient thanks to oil lubrication and are 9 times more efficient than standard bearings and will spin for up to 47 minutes after being run at 500rpms.
Campagnolo engineering staff have developed a new construction that provides a braking performance superior to other carbon rims. The AC3 (All Condition Carbon Control) technology not only improves braking in the dry but boosts performance by 43% over past Campagnolo models and nearly 55% over that of its closest rivals when the roads get wet. Apart from the obvious textured braking surface the construction of the new Bora wheels also underwent internal improvement to ensure maximum integrity when faced with the increased force and heat deriving from the new braking surface.
One of the biggest changes and improvements to the Bora Ultra 35 Wheelset is the increased rim width, moving from 20.5 to 24.2 mm. This allows the Bora Ultra 35 Wheelset to improve its aerodynamic properties and house wider tyres, thus increasing the control and creating a more comfortable ride. The wider rim also contributes to an increase in structural strength, thus increasing the already lauded resistance and reliability of the Bora family.
