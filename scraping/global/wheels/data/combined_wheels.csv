Zipp 404 Firecrest Carbon Tubeless Disc Brake Front Wheel,"Zipp’s 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake is the icon of speed with three decades of use.
The 404’s heritage as Zipp’s icon of speed extends back decades, and its future is even brighter. At 58mm deep, the 404 Firecrest Tubeless is ideal for road races, time trial and triathlon, and gran fondos. The wheelset’s 23mm internal width is perfect for running wider tubeless tires at reduced air pressure.
That is a vital component of Total System Efficiency, or TSE, an approach to speed on ever-changing roads and riding conditions. Specifically, TSE focuses on overcoming specific barriers to speed: wind resistance, gravity, rolling resistance, and vibration losses.
Zipp’s ABLC Sawtooth Technology uses an intricate dimpling pattern to improve aero efficiency. Zipp’s use of hookless (straight side) rims in the 404 Firecrest is integral to Making You Faster. With hookless, the transition between the tire and the rim is more seamless and aero. Zipp’s hookless rims have more efficient resin distribution, which means lighter, stronger wheels.
Outdoor testing commissioned by Zipp revealed the real-world gains of Zipp TSE. A bike- and-rider system weighing 85kg (187lbs) on the new 404 Firecrest with 25mm tires required 286 watts to maintain a speed of 40kph. That’s a 4-watt savings compared with the previous model 404 Firecrest.
At the center of the 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake is a versatile and durable hubset, the German-engineered ZR1 DB. If you had to choose just one wheel for road riding and racing, the 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc brake is a savvy and speedy choice.
Technology:

Total System Efficiency
ABLC Dimples

Features:

Versatile race wheelset for the modern road race bike with tubeless and hookless rim profile

CushCore Tyre Insert - Single,"The original full-performance version. CushCore allows you to push the limits of your tyres and suspension to new levels. The best choice for the majority of wheels, terrain, and riders.
How it works:
Not all tyre inserts are created the same.
CushCore is no ordinary tyre insert and is based on a new concept, tyre suspension. Any suspension system has a spring and a damper, and with CushCore, pressurised air in the tyre is the spring and the CushCore tyre insert is the damper.
Like traditional suspension, a constant damping force wouldn't work. It has to be dynamic. Suspension should be supple on small bumps but firm on the big hits.
CushCore responds differently depending on the tyre load and scenario. The more the tyre flexes, the more damping it provides.

Go Bigger - CushCore improves suspension performance by 16% and reduces impact force from big hits by 50%. Send it with total confidence.
Corner Harder - 35% more sidewall stability eliminates tyre squirm and burping, even at low tyre pressure. Rail corners with total confidence.
Ride Faster - CushCore provides a 12% smoother ride and 3% reduced rolling resistance. Ride with more control, more momentum, and less fatigue. It's like taking fewer punches in a fight.

Includes:

(1) CushCore tyre insert,
(1) 44mm CushCore green presta air valve,
Rim stickers.

Thanks to its hard-wearing aluminium rims, it provides excellent strength and durability as you clock up the miles. Fulcrum has also equipped this model with 24 stainless steel, straight-pull spokes and brass nipples for increased rigidity as you put the power down. Coming complete with sealed cartridge bearings, disc brake compatibility and a range of ride-enhancing technologies, this is a great choice for dependable performance at an affordable price.
The great versatility of these wheels, whether training or on road rides with a gravel bike, is ensured by the updated low profile 24mm aluminium rims and an inner rim channel of 20mm, with the 2 Way Fit system.
The technical specifications of the Racing 6 DB ensure that they excel in different situations, climbing as well as windy conditions, and they can also fit wider tyres, clincher or tubeless (tubeless tape installed and valves included).
2-Way Fit Technology
2-Way Fit profile for tubeless and clincher. Tubeless technology was first used by the auto industry, then by motorcycles and now has reached the cycling industry. After its debut with mountain bikes the moment has come to “put it on the road”, and that’s what Fulcrum propose to do. The brand has developed its 2-Way Fit technology to ensure the perfect compatibility of its tubeless rims with normal clincher types and tubes. 2-Way Fit road bike wheels are perfectly multipurpose for tackling every situation. Thanks to a special impression in the valve area, the tubes are fitted with maximum precision while keeping the tube perfectly stable inside the tyre. Housing the valve for tubeless tyres is also risk-free, with the unquestionable advantage that there are never any air infiltrations caused by non-ideal positioning when fitting.
AFS Axle System
The Axial Fixing System is the solution developed by Fulcrum to fix the disc brake to the hub. The constraint granted by the butt area of the release mechanism, greater than in familiar standard ones, makes it possible to obtain greater structural rigidity and therefore more precise and powerful braking.
F.I.C 100% Handmade Quality
Fulcrum Identification Card (F.I.C) 100%handemade quality. Right from its inception, Fulcrum has been marked by a feature that continues to this day: that is to design, prototype and industrialise all the wheels characterised by the red “F”.
