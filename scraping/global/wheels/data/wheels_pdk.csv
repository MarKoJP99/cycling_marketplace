Zipp 404 Firecrest Carbon Tubeless Disc Brake Front Wheel,"Zipp’s 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake is the icon of speed with three decades of use.
The 404’s heritage as Zipp’s icon of speed extends back decades, and its future is even brighter. At 58mm deep, the 404 Firecrest Tubeless is ideal for road races, time trial and triathlon, and gran fondos. The wheelset’s 23mm internal width is perfect for running wider tubeless tires at reduced air pressure.
That is a vital component of Total System Efficiency, or TSE, an approach to speed on ever-changing roads and riding conditions. Specifically, TSE focuses on overcoming specific barriers to speed: wind resistance, gravity, rolling resistance, and vibration losses.
Zipp’s ABLC Sawtooth Technology uses an intricate dimpling pattern to improve aero efficiency. Zipp’s use of hookless (straight side) rims in the 404 Firecrest is integral to Making You Faster. With hookless, the transition between the tire and the rim is more seamless and aero. Zipp’s hookless rims have more efficient resin distribution, which means lighter, stronger wheels.
Outdoor testing commissioned by Zipp revealed the real-world gains of Zipp TSE. A bike- and-rider system weighing 85kg (187lbs) on the new 404 Firecrest with 25mm tires required 286 watts to maintain a speed of 40kph. That’s a 4-watt savings compared with the previous model 404 Firecrest.
At the center of the 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake is a versatile and durable hubset, the German-engineered ZR1 DB. If you had to choose just one wheel for road riding and racing, the 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc brake is a savvy and speedy choice.
Technology:

Total System Efficiency

Features:

Versatile race wheelset for the modern road race bike with tubeless and hookless rim profile
Optimized tire bed for easy tire installation

Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Tubular Front Wheel,"Zipp’s 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher is an all-around wheelset in every way. It’s rich in heritage yet loaded with innovations. It’s as adept in the mountains as it is on rolling hills, windswept farm lanes, or ferocious field sprints.
At Zipp, we never rest on laurels. Our engineers can’t sit still long enough to – they’re too busy innovating. Think lighter weight. Think greater speed and control. Think increased stopping power. One of our all-time best-selling wheelsets, the 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher offers dramatic improvements over its predecessors:
More Speed: Revised rim profile for reduced aerodynamic drag developed by our advanced development team in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.
Greater AeroBalance™: ABLC™ Sawtooth™ Technology, a complex dimpling pattern first developed for our top-level NSW wheel lineup. This technology helps to achieve the optimization of low aerodynamic drag and crosswind stability, which we call AeroBalance.
Better braking: Zipp’s ShowStopper™ textured braking surface delivers unrivalled rim braking performance in wet or dry conditions.
Lighter Weight: The 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher is 145 grams lighter than its previous iteration.",https://www.probikekit.com/bicycle-wheels/zipp-303-firecrest-carbon-tubular-front-wheel/12509885.html,No components found,$745.49
CushCore Tyre Insert - Single,"The original full-performance version. CushCore allows you to push the limits of your tyres and suspension to new levels. The best choice for the majority of wheels, terrain, and riders.
How it works:
Not all tyre inserts are created the same.
CushCore is no ordinary tyre insert and is based on a new concept, tyre suspension. Any suspension system has a spring and a damper, and with CushCore, pressurised air in the tyre is the spring and the CushCore tyre insert is the damper.
Like traditional suspension, a constant damping force wouldn't work. It has to be dynamic. Suspension should be supple on small bumps but firm on the big hits.
CushCore responds differently depending on the tyre load and scenario. The more the tyre flexes, the more damping it provides.

Go Bigger - CushCore improves suspension performance by 16% and reduces impact force from big hits by 50%. Send it with total confidence.
Corner Harder - 35% more sidewall stability eliminates tyre squirm and burping, even at low tyre pressure. Rail corners with total confidence.
Ride Faster - CushCore provides a 12% smoother ride and 3% reduced rolling resistance. Ride with more control, more momentum, and less fatigue. It's like taking fewer punches in a fight.

Includes:

(1) CushCore tyre insert,
(1) 44mm CushCore green presta air valve,
Rim stickers.
