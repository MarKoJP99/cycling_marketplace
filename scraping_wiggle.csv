DT Swiss ARC 1400 DICUT Disc Brake Rear Wheel,"The Conquerors of Kona; the first generation ARC's were 3-times gold medal winners, victorious at the 2017, 2018 and 2019 Triathlon World Championships
Developments in disc brake and tyre technology have meant that even the best needed to evolve to take advantage of the latest tyre technology and the frames able to accept them
For the past 3 years, working with their aerodynamic R&D partners Swissside DT, have been continuously testing the latest generation of disc brake specific aerodynamic rims, hubs and spokes
The result is a family of new, 20 mm wide (internal) rim profiles optimised for 25-28c tubeless tyres that have been proven by extensive lab and real world testing to enable lower rolling resistance and improved crosswind handling whilst achieving incremental reductions in drag, even over the original ARC designs
As the leading hub engineering force on cycling, DT continue to push the boundaries of what can be expected from a racing hub, the new DICUT 180 with 36 tooth Ratchet EXP is the lightest, simplest, lowest drag road disc hub DT have ever made and still just as reliable and easy to service as the legendary 240
DT and Swissside's continuing leading-edge research into rotational drag and its effect on performance has lead to new, narrower Aerolite II and Aerocomp II spokes, unique to the ARC's these are what you can do when you design and make every part of the wheel and squeeze even more performance out of the system without the unproven reliability of less durable materials

The front wheel comes ready for 12 x 100 mm thru axles, rear comes ready for 12 x 142 mm thru axles
Maximum recommended system weight: 110 KG
When bought as a pair they will include both Shimano Road and SRAM XDR freehubs, rim tape and lightweight tubeless valves

Zipp 404 Firecrest Carbon Tubeless Disc Brake Front Wheel,"Zipp’s 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake is the icon of speed with three decades of use.
The 404’s heritage as Zipp’s icon of speed extends back decades, and its future is even brighter. At 58mm deep, the 404 Firecrest Tubeless is ideal for road races, time trial and triathlon, and gran fondos. The wheelset’s 23mm internal width is perfect for running wider tubeless tires at reduced air pressure.
That is a vital component of Total System Efficiency, or TSE, an approach to speed on ever-changing roads and riding conditions. Specifically, TSE focuses on overcoming specific barriers to speed: wind resistance, gravity, rolling resistance, and vibration losses.
Zipp’s ABLC Sawtooth Technology uses an intricate dimpling pattern to improve aero efficiency. Zipp’s use of hookless (straight side) rims in the 404 Firecrest is integral to Making You Faster. With hookless, the transition between the tire and the rim is more seamless and aero. Zipp’s hookless rims have more efficient resin distribution, which means lighter, stronger wheels.
Outdoor testing commissioned by Zipp revealed the real-world gains of Zipp TSE. A bike- and-rider system weighing 85kg (187lbs) on the new 404 Firecrest with 25mm tires required 286 watts to maintain a speed of 40kph. That’s a 4-watt savings compared with the previous model 404 Firecrest.
At the center of the 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake is a versatile and durable hubset, the German-engineered ZR1 DB. If you had to choose just one wheel for road riding and racing, the 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc brake is a savvy and speedy choice.

Stans NoTubes Flow MK4 Rim,"Since 2007, the Flow rim has been helping riders progress, push boundaries, and do more on their bikes. The original Flow was light, wide, tubeless, and strong as hell. It redefined mountain bike rims and played a role in the evolution of riding. Today's Flow MK4 continues the progression with a 30mm wide asymmetric rim designed to build an even stronger overall wheel.
Durability and an almost uncanny feeling of control on the trail have made Flow rims the preferred choice of multiple Red Bull Rampage riders, and today’s Flow goes even further. The Flow MK4’s reinforced spoke bed, combined with the offset drilling of the asym design, builds into an incredibly durable wheel that brings added confidence to every ride.
Unlike many asymmetric rims, the Flow MK4's BST-Asymmetric shape is designed to equalize resistance to dents and tire bead retention on both sides of the rim under even the worst rock gardens and hardest cornering. Combined with Stan's patented Bead Socket Technology, the Flow MK4 rim offers the easiest tubeless setup and most reliable airtight performance on the trail.
Ramp up your progression and make every ride even better with the confidence of Flow MK4 asymmetric rims.

DT Swiss ARC 1400 DICUT Clincher Disc Brake Wheelset - 62 mm,"With a mid-depth, aerodynamic, full carbon rim, reliable and strong hubs and a sturdy build, the DT Swiss ARC 1400 DICUT 62mm Disc Brake Wheelset is the perfect choice when versatility is needed for riding over moderate climbs and along fast valleys.
The rims are realised in a refined grade of carbon fibre that infuses reactivity into any ride thanks to its low weight and high lateral rigidity. This carbon material is formed into a 62mm deep rim profile that has been honed in the wind tunnel via input from aerodynamic experts SWISS SIDE to be fast and stable through a full sweep of riding scenarios. The rims' aerodynamic prowess is complemented by their broad, 20mm internal widths that help to lower rolling resistance and improve ride comfort by better supporting the sidewalls of tubeless-ready or standard clincher tyres.
DT Swiss 240 hubs spin smoothly, and their rigid alloy hub shells improve braking performance by donating a rock-solid platform for disc rotor mounting. An EXP ratchet freehub body is integrated neatly into the rear hub, and this has a super-quick engagement system to quicken response to pedalling input. The hubs are linked to the rims by the bladed Aero Comp spokes laced in sturdy two-cross patterns.

Zipp 808 NSW Carbon Clincher Rear Wheel,"The pursuit of AeroBalance™ defines Zipp’s approach to wheel design, especially at the 82mm-deep 808 rim depth. Combining low drag performance with stable handling is our mission, because speed without control, is useless. To that end, the Zipp 808 NSW Carbon Clincher Tubeless rim-brake wheelset features a redesigned rim shape that aerodynamically integrates wider tubeless tires for a new era or high-performance road cycling.
The 808 NSW Carbon Clincher Tubeless allows you to run tubeless or traditional clinchers. The benefits of tubeless include superior flat protection, the ability to run lower pressures, and a smoother ride with high cornering grip and low rolling resistance. The 808 NSW Carbon Clincher Tubeless wheels – along with the 303 and 404 versions -- also feature a wider 19mm internal rim width and corresponding outer rim shape for aerodynamic optimization with 25mm tires. Tires such as the Zipp Tangente RT25 Road Tubeless are a perfect match for this wheelset to deliver exceptionally low rolling resistance and high cornering grip.
When it comes time to slow for a corner, our NSW exclusive Showstopper™ brake track stands ready to deliver the best modulation and shortest stopping distances available, regardless of weather conditions or the length of the descent.",https://www.probikekit.com/bicycle-wheels/zipp-808-nsw-carbon-clincher-rear-wheel/12509846.html,No components found,$1098.99
